This disk contains the reflpak suite of reflectometery reduction and fitting 
programs from the NIST Center for Neutron Research.  

You may run the programs directly from the disk image, or copy the 
reflpak-xxxx directory somewhere on your harddrive.  Keep the icons
together in the same directory as reflpak.bin or they will not work.

Within the reflpak directory is reflpak.bin (the binary) and four icons 
which you may drag to your dock.  The reflpak icon starts a menu from 
which you can choose from the three applications: reflred for reduction, 
reflfit for fitting and reflpol for fitting of polarized data.  Clicking 
on the other three icons starts these applications directly.

This is pre-release open source software --- standard disclaimers apply
and will be filled in later.
