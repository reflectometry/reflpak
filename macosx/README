This disk contains the reflpak suite of reflectometery reduction 
and fitting programs from the NIST Center for Neutron Research.  

You may run the programs directly from the disk image, or copy them to
your applications directory on your harddrive. 

The reflpak application requires an X11 server in order to run.  This
is available on your OS X install disks.

The reduction software requires an Octave server in addition to X11.
We have included a standard version of Octave with the additional
server command from the octave-forge miscellaneous package.  To start 
the server, click on the Octave icon then type 

    server(1515)

This needs to be done once before the application.
