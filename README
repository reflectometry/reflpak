This is the build directory for the fitting and reduction
programs. If you are here, then you are trying to build 
your own copy.


Manifest
========

src/

  C source for mlayer, converted to be a tcl loadable module.

gj2/

  C source for gj2, converted to be a tcl loadable module.  

lib/

  Stand-alone tcl packages used by reflred and reflfit

tcl/

  Tcl scripts for reflfit (also needs lib/ and src/)

reflred/

  Tcl scripts for reflred (also needs src/)

freewrap/

  Tcl scripts and C source for freewrap.  This needs
  to be replaced by a starkit infrastructure since
  freewrap is no longer supported (?).  Stubs-enabled
  BLT would be nice.  Architecture specific make files 
  are in arch/Makefile.freewrap.  See README.freewrap 
  for build details.  (Note that there are some prebuilt 
  versions of freewrapBLT floating around on the net, 
  and in particular, my Windows build does not work.)

irix/
linux/
win/
macosx/

  Architecture specific build directories containing
  Makefile.freewrap, freewrapBLT and Makeconf for
  each architecture.

Makefile
reflred.tcl.in
reflfit.tcl.in

  Build files reflfit and reflred

tclConfig2Makeconf

  Convert tclConfig.sh to Makeconf.tcltk for use in
  compiling freewrapBLT (on some architectures).

  Detailed list of changes.

Build
=====

You first need to link an appropriate configuration
file to Makeconf.  E.g.,

  ln -s linux/Makeconf .

If none exists, create a new directory and copy
the closest configuration file as a starting point.

Make sure your architecture directory contains
freewrapBLT.  See README.freewrap for build
instructions.

Type make.  The resulting files are:

	arch/gmlayer.$LDEXT	the loadable module for mlayer
	gj2/gj2.$LDEXT		the loadable module for gj2
	reflfit.tcl		the driver program for reflfit
	reflpol.tcl		the driver program for reflpol
	reflred.tcl		the driver program for reflred
	reflfit$EXE		wrapped versions of same
	reflpol$EXE
	reflred$EXE
