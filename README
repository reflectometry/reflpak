This is the build directory for the fitting and reduction
programs. If you are here, then you are trying to build 
your own copy.


Manifest
========

src/

  C source for mlayer, converted to be a tcl loadable module.

gj2/

  C source for gj2, converted to be a tcl loadable module.  

lib/

  Stand-alone tcl packages used by reflred and reflfit

tcl/

  Tcl scripts for reflfit (also needs lib/ and src/)

reflred/

  Tcl scripts for reflred (also needs src/)

reflpak/

  Tcl scripts for the main package

scifun/

  Tcl extension package providing access to C99 math functions

winlink/

  Tcl extension package providing access to windows shortcuts.

freewrap/

  (Obsolete)
  Tcl scripts and C source for freewrap.  This needs
  to be replaced by a starkit infrastructure since
  freewrap is no longer supported (?).  Stubs-enabled
  BLT would be nice.  Architecture specific make files 
  are in arch/Makefile.freewrap.  See README.freewrap 
  for build details.  (Note that there are some prebuilt 
  versions of freewrapBLT floating around on the net, 
  and in particular, my Windows build does not work.)

irix/
linux/
win/
macosx/

  Architecture specific build directories containing
  Makeconf for each architecture and other architecture
  specific files.

Makefile
main.tcl

  Build files reflfit and reflred

reflpak.tcl

  Script for running unbundled in the source tree.

tclConfig2Makeconf

  Convert tclConfig.sh to Makeconf.tcltk for use in
  compiling freewrapBLT (on some architectures).

Build
=====

To build reflpak, you will first need to create Makeconf, or
link to the appropriate version:

  ln -s linux/Makeconf .

If none exists, create a new directory and copy
the closest configuration file as a starting point.

Make sure you have ncnrkit and sdx.kit for your computer architecture.
Both are available from the reflpak web pages, or you may build
your own according to the instructions in mkncnrkit.


Type make.  The resulting files are:

	tcl/gmlayer.$LDEXT	the loadable module for mlayer
	tcl/gj2.$LDEXT		the loadable module for gj2
	kit/reflpak$EXE

Type make dist.  Depending on which system you are on, you will
either have:

	release/reflpakYYYYMMDD.dmg (arch=macosx)
	reflpakYYYYMMDD-arch.tar.gz (arch=linux or arch=irix)
	reflpakYYYYMMDD.exe (arch=win)
