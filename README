This is the build directory for the fitting program.
I may put reduction in here later, but I don't know yet.

If you are here, then you are trying to build your
own copy of the program.

As it currently stands, I have the C source in src/
(this is just mlayer for now, but gj2 is going to
have to go somewhere --- I would very much like to
merge the code bases for the two, but I think I
will have to hold off on that for a little bit longer,
so don't be surprised if src is renamed src-mlayer,
and is accompanied by src-gj2.

The bulk of the tcl code is in tcl/.

There are four separate environment directories:
  irix, linux, macosx and win
These contain the freewrapBLT binary which I need
to wrap tcl/tk apps

For each of these, it should be a matter of changing
to the directory, typing editting ./configure to 
pick up the appropriate tclConfig.sh script, running
./configure, then running make.

The output of this is:

	gmlayer.$SHLEXT		the loadable module
	reflfit.tcl		the driver program
	reflfit$EXE		the wrapped executable
