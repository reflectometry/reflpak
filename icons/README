save2icons.scm:
	gimp macro which saves the visible channels of the current
	image as a set of png files suitable for making into icons.
	Copy to ~/.gimp<version>/scripts, and invoke using
		Xtns > Script-FU > User > Save as icons...

	Note that this script doesn't work very well --- it doesn't
	seem to be saving the icons as appropriate indexed images.
	Also, sometimes it doesn't work (maybe when I have multiple
	files open?), so I restart gimp and it works then.

	Use 'png2ico basename.ico basename_*.png' to convert the
	set of png files to an icon file.  On OS X, I use Iconverter
	to convert the .ico file into a .icns file.

	If you create new .ico/.xcf files, be sure to add them to
	cvs as binaries using
		cvs add -kb file...

icons.tcl:
	tcl app to view sets of icons.  This works no matter what
	operating system you are running.

		./icons.tcl *.ico
