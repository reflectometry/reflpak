hpage attenuator .attenuator {See also [attenuator controls].

This window contains the attenuator scale factors for each segment of 
the run.  Enter attenuator values into the table.  You can also enter
expressions.

At present the "align" button on the [compose] window doesn't work very well.
It only works if the curves overlap at a single point.  It
aligns every curve in the sequence, even if two curves are
about equal, so the estimated error is very large.  It does
not find the best attenuator value to use for all overlapping
curves.  Do not use it for correct reduction, but you can use
it to get a quick view of your aligned curves.

# It is possible to align a pair of overlapping curves using
# shift-right-click.  This will give a list of overlapping
# curves and you can select one to align with.  *This is work
# in progress!*  The value is only correct if there is a single
# point of overlap.  If the attenuation on the two curves is
# approximately equal you should copy the values from one to

hpage compose . {See also [compose controls] [windows] 

The run composer is the main window of reflred.  From
here you can view and plot individual data files, and compose them
into complete scans.  You can access most of the other [windows] 
directly from the menu.

The initial list contains data files from the directory/pattern
given on the command line, or from the current directory if none was
given.  You can select a different data set from the [choose] window
(Data... on the menu).

Files are grouped according to the activity of the motors:

>It is a slit scan if the beam is straight through 
but the slit motors are moving.

>It is a rocking curve if the incident angle 
is fixed but the reflected angle is varying.

>It is a specular scan if the incident angle 
matches the reflected angle.

>It is a background scan if the incident angle 
does not match the reflected angle.  

Background scans are tagged with + if the reflected angle is greater
than the incident angle, or - if the reflected angle is greater than
the incident angle.

There are a few rare scan types possible.  A height scan is indicated
by movement of motor 12 on NG-7.  If no motors are moving, but
temperature is being recorded then it will be classified as a
temperature scan.  Similarly for applied field.  If nothing is
changing then the file is tagged as a time evolution (or a single
point slit scan if the beam is straight through).

Shown next to each data file is a box indicating the total range for
the data set.  The shaded portion of the box indicates the Qz range
for that file.  The vertical bar indicates a value of Qz = 0, or for
Qx = 0 in the case of rocking curves.  For slit scans, the data range
indicates the slit 1 opening.  For temperature scans, time evolution,
or height scans, the data range indicates temperature, time or height
respectively.

For NG-1 and X-Ray files there is no data column for Qz.  Instead
Qz is calculated from motor A3 (incident angle) or A4 (incident
plus reflected angle).  For rocking curves it must be A3 and
for specular scans it doesn't matter since A3 is 2*A4.  For background
scans however either A3 or A4 can be the basis for Qz, with the other
being the offset.  This is indicated in the file selection tree by
the label Background Q(A3) or Background Q(A4).  It should be obvious
which is correct by comparing the Q range of the background with the
Q range of the corresponding specular.  Click the label to toggle, or
select "Options Background A#" from the menu to change them all.  Doing
so will change the Q range on the selected files as well, but not on
the previously composed scans.

All runs are displayed with the same monitor count, which is the
monitor of the first run selected.  You can scale each run
independently using the [attenuator] window (Attenuator... in the
menu), or click "align" to calculate the attenuators automatically.
WARNING: the attenuator calculator does not work reliably.  Read 
the details in [attenuator].

Note: you cannot combine NG1 runs counted against monitor and time in 
the same scan.  The NG1 monitor is positioned between slit 1 and slit 2,
so as slit 1 opens, the monitor rate increases which means the counting
time decreases within the run.  When counting against time, the
counting time is fixed within the run. The correct way to handle this 
is to reduce the monitor and time data separately then join the 
reduced lines.

NG-7 data is scaled by monitor count when it is loaded.  A dead
time correction is applied to the monitor count, which is linearly
interpolated from the data in the file reflectivity/NG7monitor.cal.  
You can see the calibration data by opening the [Tcl console] and typing
	load_NG7_monitor_calibration
	set NG7_monitor_calibration

Since the NG7 monitor does not count every neutron, there will be 
a detector to monitor ratio that needs to be measured.  Once 
measured, this can be entered on the reduce screen as a transmission 
coefficient, entered as an attenuator, or saved as an ICP file and
used as a slit scan.  Since the detector to monitor ratio is
not a constant especially at low Q, a slit scan taken at several
points will give the best results.

Once you have selected your sequence of files, click "Accept" to
average them into a complete scan.  The resulting average will be
displayed as a separate scan line.  Click on the legend entry to hide
it, or click "Clear" to remove it.  The "Clear" button first removes
the selected runs, then removes the scans.  Scans are available for
further processing in the [reduce] window (Reduce... in the menu).

For polarized beam, you will have to select A, B, C and D separately.
Once you accept, separate lines will be created for each index.

hpage reduce .reduce {See also [reduce controls].

The reduce window is where you collect the various scans to create the
reflectivity signal.  This is a confusing screen.

The basic formula is (specular-background)/slitscan.  In addition there
is scaling by the [transmission coefficient] of the sample environment,
polarization correction for polarized beam and [footprint correction].

Select all specular lines.  These will appear on the legend annotated with
a plus, and the "specular" entry will show the average of all the specular
lines.  The highlighted line is the final reduction, which at this
point will just be the average of the specular.  So selecting one line
will display it overlayed by the identical average overlayed by the
identical reduced line.

Next select all background lines.  These will appear on the legend
annotated with a minus, the "background" entry will show the average
of all the background lines, and the "subtracted" entry will show the
difference between the specular and the background. The highlighted 
reduced line will now overlay the subtracted line. Note that [psd] 
data will already have the background subtracted from the specular, 
so no need to select any. 

For NG-1 and X-ray data you need to divide by a slit-scan.  This is 
a sequence of data taken with the same slit settings as the specular 
and background data but directly counting the beam rather than its
reflection. Because the detector is directly in line with the beam for
a slit scan, there is no Qz value intrinsic to the specific slit openings.
Instead for each Qz in the specular data, you must lookup the value of
the slit 1 opening for that particular Qz in the slit data and this is
your slit scan.  Linear interpolation is used if the slit values are
not exactly aligned.  NG-7 data does not use slit scans but instead 
the specular and background data is divided by the monitor count when 
the data is loaded.  Note that NG-7's monitor does not count all
incident neutrons.  Instead, you will have a "slit to monitor" ratio
by which you need to scale the reflectivity curve.  You can enter this
value as a factor in the "incident medium transmission coefficient" or
if it is measured in a file, divided it through as a single point
slit scan \[untested as of this writing\].  Note that the slit to monitor
ratio decreases as the slit width approaches zero, so for careful 
experiments you may want to measure the slit scan across many points.

Select all the slit scan lines.   These will appear on the legend 
annotated with a slash, but will not appear on the graph.  If you 
select the legend entry, the actual data will appear but it will
be counts versus slit 1 where slit 1 values go across the top axis
rather than along the bottom axis, so there will be no correspondence
with the Qz values of the specular or background curves.  The slit 
scan entry represents Qz value of the specular interpolated into the 
average of all the individual slit scans.  The divided entry is 
(specular - background)/slit, which will be overlayed by the 
highlighted reduced line.

The next step is to calculate the [footprint correction].  Click the
Parameters... button to enter the footprint parameters.  You can
suppress the footprint correction by toggling the associated check
box on this screen.

Finally, you can scale the data by the "incident medium transmission
coefficient".  If you "Guess" at the value, then it will scale the data
so that the peak reflectivity is 1.0.  The error on the scale factor
will equal the error on the peak value.

Save your data as linear and/or print the graph and you are done.  The
header will contain details of all the files which went into the reduced
(Q,R,dR) data columns.

2002-09-18}

hpage {transmission coefficient} {} {See also [reduce].

Transmission coefficient is a scalar multiplier for the reflectivity and
can be used for several different purposes:  

 * For NG-7 data is divided by the monitor.  If you set the transmission
   coefficient to the detector to monitor ratio (usually about 12) you will 
   get normalized reflectivity.

 * For sample environments with significant absorption, set the transmission
   coefficient to the attenuation you expect through the medium.

 * For back reflectivity, where the beam enters the side of the substrate
   and reflects off the back side of the film, set the transmission 
   coefficient to the absorption you expect in the substrate.

These effects are multiplicative.

If you don't know the correct value of the transmission coefficient, you
can guess by looking at the data below the critical angle.  There is a
flat region which should be perfectly reflecting.  Take the average of
the values in this region and use that for the transmission coefficient.
The "Guess" button in Reflred uses the maximum value of the reflectivity
rather than the average value.

Please make sure the guessed value makes sense.  If for example the
critical edge is too low, you may not see it in the data and the
guessed transmission coefficient will be too high.

hpage {footprint correction} .footprint {
If the incident slits are fixed, the fraction of the sample area
illuminated by the beam increases without bound as the incident angle  
(theta) decreases.  For high Q, you can avoid correcting for this 
geometrical effect and simultaneously increase the flux incident on the
sample by linearly opening the slits with increasing angle such that a
constant area of the sample is illuminated at each Q.

For small Q, however, the variable slit openings would then approach
zero as the angle decreases and the flux incident on the sample may be
too small.  As a result the slits are sometimes held fixed for small Q
and an ever-increasing fraction of the beam will spill over the sample
surface as the incident angle approaches zero (Fig 1).  For fixed or
variable slits, the signal will rise sharply near zero as the detector 
enters the main beam.

	[img::footprint.gif]
	Fig. 1: Beam spills over the sample edges as the
	incident angle approaches zero.

Our goal with footprint correction is to compensate for the geometric
effects resulting from the use of fixed slits.   Assuming a rectangular
sample (or a fully illuminated sample of arbitrary shape), the fraction
of beam which intercepts the sample will decrease linearly with Q.
Since sin(theta) ~ theta near theta=0, the portion will also decrease
linearly with incident angle.  To correct for this effect, you should 
divide by a line up until the end of the correction region, and a
constant thereafter.

There are several cases:

(1) A flat region is apparent below the critical angle: Normalizes 
this flat region to one (e.g., by fitting the plateau) and ignore all 
data below the flat region.

[img::fpflat.gif]
	Fig 2: Flat region after "V".  The plateau is marked with
	red "+". Fit to intercept b (the slope m is zero).

Note that you should have some explanation for why intensity of the
plateau is not unity.  For example, if the slit scan was taken in
air but the reflected intensity was measured in vacuum, the 
plateau will be above unity.  Similarly, if the beam is wider than 
the sample, not all the beam will be reflected, and the plateau will
be below unity.

(2) The data linearly increases below the critical angle:  Approximate
the footprint correction by fitting a line to the linear region,   
stopping the fit where the data curve into the critical region.  The
footprint correction window will tell you the Q value where the
footprint correction is equal to 1.  You should apply the footprint  
correction up to that Q value or up to the end of the fixed slit region,
whichever occurs at the lowest Q.

[img::fplinear.gif]
	Fig 3: No flat region after "V". Linear portion is marked
	with red "+".  Fit to line m*Qz+b.  Note the linear scale 
	on the right hand axis.

>(3) Neither a flat region nor a sloped region is evident below the  
critical angle:  In this case calculate the footprint correction from
the geometry of your sample and enter it directly  (Tools for this
calculation are not yet available in reflred).  If your sample is not
rectangular, you may not be able to calculate the footprint correction,
and you will need to measure it (see below).

Since the second case is the most common, we consider it here in more
detail.  First zoom into the reduce graphs so that you can see both
the fixed slit region simultaneous with the corresponding
reflectivity.  Be sure that the y-axis for the reflectivity uses a
_linear_ scale so that you can locate the flat portion of the rising
slope.  Click Parameters... to select the footprint fit parameters.

In the footprint window, select 'Fit footprint correction' and click
the 'From graph...' button.  You will want to first select the lowest
Q point of your data which does not include scattering from the main
beam.  (This is at the bottom of the "V" in the reflectivity signal
assuming you have measured below about 0.005 inv Angstroms).  Next
choose the last point which is approximately linear.  Make sure the
m*Qz+b selection is active (use b if fitting a plateau, use m*Qz if you
want to constrain the footprint to go through zero a Qz = 0).

Having specified the slope and intercept, or having selected the fit
region from the graph, you must then select the portion of the curve
over which to apply the footprint correction.  You can again click
'From graph...' to select points from the graph.  Usually the
correction should be applied from the bottom of the "V" to the Q value
corresponding to the end of the fixed slit region.

For NG1 and X-ray data, the fixed slit region will be obvious from the
measured slit scan.  For NG7 you will have to go back to the data
selection window and examine the first file in your specular sequence
to see where the fixed slit region stops.  \[Use the right mouse
button on the specular scan you are using from the list of specular
scans and select 'Edit'.]  Often NG7 data is taken with continously
varying slits.

Click the Apply button to fit and apply the footprint
correction. Notice that the value of the footprint correction
specified at the end of the application range divided through the
entire Q range of your reflectivity scan.  This value, listed at the
bottom of the footprint dialog, should be less than one.  If it is
not, use the Qz value where the correction is 1.0 given on the next
line as the upper end of "Correct from" range.

Your footprint correction is now complete.  If you do not wish to
apply it, click off the "Footprint correction" check box on the [reduce]
screen.

Note that if your sample is not rectangular or fully illuminated, 
the footprint correction will no longer be linear.  In that case
you will have to measure the footprint correction directly (Case 3).  
First measure a sample of the same dimension and with a critical angle
greater than the fixed slit region for your experiment.  Reduce that
scan (being sure to divide by a slit scan if necessary) and save it.
Now select the scan you wish to correct and click 'Parameters...' to
get to the footprint window.  Choose the footprint scan from the
'Measured footprint correction' dropdown list.  From the graph, select
the region you want to correct as zero to the critical angle of the
footprint scan.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
hpage {psd} .psd {See also [psd controls].

Position sensitive detector data is a 2-D array.  Instead of a single
pencil detector a linear array of detectors is deployed, so for each
incident angle you can simultaneously measure an array of reflected
angles.  Each Qz slice in the ICP file thus corresponds to a rocking
curve.  From this curve we can estimate the specular and background
signal simultaneously.

The psd window shows four different graphs.  The top left graph shows
data from the entire PSD array as a false color plot.  Below and beside
this are graphs of slices through the array.  On the bottom right is
a graph of the specular, background and subtracted data derived from
the array. The legend on the top right shows the colour values 
corresponding to the levels in the array.  

There are two dashed vertical lines overlaying the array.  The data 
between these lines is integrated to form the specular scan.  An equal 
width region surrounding the specular region is integrated to form 
the background scan.  These are subtracted to form the reduced data.
Once the region is selected, you can use the [attenuator] window to 
scale the data as usual.  The graph to the right shows the levels 
for each line.

By clicking the middle button in the array you can get a cross section
through the data.  The vertical slice shows the counts versus Qz and
is shown on the graph to the right.  The diagonal slice shows the 
counts for a constant Qz on the graph below.

hpage {Tcl console} .tkcon {Tcl 
is an easy to learn scripting language in which you will eventually be
able to automate your data reduction if you take your data
systematically.  

I will not attempt to describe tcl here.  See
http://www.msen.com/~clif/TclTutor.html for an interactive tutorial.

At present, the reduction is set up to be driven by the GUI, so
although you could automate it now it would be awkward to do so.
Here are some incomplete notes to get you started.  Be warned 
that the information given below is subject to change
without notice as the scripting interface evolves.

The active set of records is determined by a call to setdirectory.  This
takes a file pattern, categorizes all the matching files and displays them
in the file selection tree.  E.g., to load all the ng7 files in your
reflectivity directory you might use:

	setdirectory ~/refl/*.ng7

Information about individual files are stored in arrays in the global
namespace.  The name of the array is visible in parentheses beside the
name of the file when the file is selected.  You can see what information
is being stored for each file using "array get".  E.g.,

	array get recR1

To find the record associated with a particular file name, use
the function rec which searches through all categorized files for a file
of the given name.  E.g., to find 074A of dataset f524b use:

	rec f542b074.na1

This maps the array rec to the record found, so you can see the fields
using, e.g., puts $rec(file).

Records can be added to or removed from the current scan using 
toggle_section.  The following command adds recR3 to the current
scan.  The keep option makes sure that it is an add, since otherwise
it will be a toggle.

	toggle_section -keep 1 -node recR3

Once the file is selected and displayed in the graph, the data is stored
in a suite of BLT vectors.  For example, to see the vectors associated with
recR1 use:

	vector names *_recR1

Some comments on the vectors are in order:

  x_recR1	Qz value for data
  xth_recR1	theta corresponding to the Qz stored in x
  y_recR1	counts in the file normalized by monitor*prefactor
  dy_recR1	standard error on y
  ky_recR1	counts*attenuator scaled to current monitor
  kdy_recR1	standard error on ky
  idx_recR1	index of included points
  XXX_recR1	data for column XXX as stored in the ICP file

Note that not all records will exist for all files at all times.
x and xth may change if the user changes the background basis for a dataset.
ky and kdy will change whenever attenuators change or runs are added.
idx will change whenever a point is included or excluded.

Attenuators are stored for each record as rec(k) and rec(dk).  If you
change the attenuator by hand, be sure to call the following to update
the ky and kdy vectors:

	atten_set $::addrun

Once all the records are selected and the attenuators are set, you can
accept the scan with a call to addrun accept.  A table of all accepted 
scans is stored in scanindex. You can examine an individual scan with 
array get scan#, where # is the number of the scan given in the scan 
index.

	addrun accept
	array get scanindex

The rest of reduction is even less amenable to scripting.  To use
e.g. scan1 you will need to find "$scan1(name) $scan1(comment)" in
the listbox for .reduce.$scan1(type) to get the index (see the function
listbox_ordered_insert in generic.tcl for clues how to do this), then
you will need to force that index to be selected (see the listbox manual

hpage choose .choose {
The left side shows directories, the right side shows datasets.

Click a directory name to display the datasets available in that
directory.  Double-click to change to that directory.  The "."
directory is the current directory.  The ".." is the parent. All
others are subdirectories.

Click on a dataset to only work with that dataset, or click nothing to
work with all datasets simultaneously.  Click on a column header to
sort by that column (dataset name, instrument, number of runs in that
dataset, earliest run, latest run, comment).

Click "Apply" or "Ok" to categorize all files in the dataset/directory
selected.  "Apply" leaves the choose window open, "Ok" closes it.
Click "Cancel" to close the choose window.
